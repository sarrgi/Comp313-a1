#### Controls 
- Jump - W
- Move Left - A
- Move Right - D
- Pause - P 
- Pause and Main Menu - Mouse interaction


#### Explanation of game 
- Very basic platformer
- was more focused on learning unreal than "cool" mechanics
- able to achieve everything in the list well
- talka nout future vision - could potnetiall do a dash
- design in more of an iterative process

### Explanantion of Paper2d
- not necessarilly a technology but this was where a lot of my time was spent
- horrid physics
	- unused box blueprint as I couldnt tune it properly
	- would collide to fasta nhd break game, none of physics tweaks liekmass or dampenign were able to fix this
	- found it interesting how unreal has better 3d than 2d support
 - level creation is amazing
	- sprite sheet
	- super quick to produce extra levels
		- similar to blueprints technology
	- if using this in the future would love to put more time into this, both aesthetics and game design
